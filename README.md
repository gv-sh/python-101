## Numbers
In Python, numbers can be integers (like 5) or floating-point numbers (like 3.14).

```python
# Integer example
integer_example = 5

# Floating-point example
float_example = 3.14
```

**Exercise**: Assign the value `10` to a variable named `my_number` and print it.

---

## Numeric Values and Types in Python
Python supports various numeric types, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

```python
# Integer
int_value = 42

# Floating-point
float_value = 3.14159

# Complex number
complex_value = 1 + 2j
```

**Exercise**: Create a variable with a complex number and print its real and imaginary parts.

---

## Programs that Print
The `print()` function in Python is used to output data to the console.

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
print(123)
print("The value is:", 42)
```

**Exercise**: Use `print()` to display the sentence "Learning Python is fun!".

---

## Variables
Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program.

```python
my_variable = "Python"
print(my_variable)
```

**Exercise**: Create a variable named `greeting` with the value "Hello" and print it.

---

## Strings
Strings in Python are used to record text information, such as names.

```python
my_string = "Hello, Python!"
new_string = my_string + " How are you?"
formatted_string = f"{my_string} How are you?"
```

**Exercise**: Create a string that contains your name and print it.

---

## Programs that Read
Python can read user input using the `input()` function.

```python
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)
```

**Exercise**: Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them.

---

## Booleans
Boolean values in Python are the two constant objects `False` and `True`.

```python
is_true = True
is_false = False
```

**Exercise**: Create a boolean variable `is_sunny` and set it to `True` or `False` based on the weather in your area.

---

## Type Bool and Boolean Expressions
In Python, Boolean expressions are used for comparison and return either `True` or `False`.

```python
a = 5
b = 10
result = a < b
```

**Exercise**: Write a boolean expression to check if a number stored in a variable `x` is greater than 100.

---

## Selections with If
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a particular condition is true.

```python
a = 5
b = 10
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
```

**Exercise**: Write an `if` statement to print "Welcome!" if a variable `age` is greater than 18.

---

## Indefinite Loops with While
A `while` loop in Python repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Exercise**: Use a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.

---

## Definite Loops with For
A `for` loop in

 Python is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

**Exercise**: Write a `for` loop to print each character in the string "Python".

---

## Pass, Break, Continue
`pass`, `break`, and `continue` are control statements used inside loops in Python.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        continue
    elif i == 8:
        break
    else:
        pass
    print(i)
```

**Exercise**: Modify the above loop to skip numbers divisible by 3.

---

## Using Library Functions
Python includes a vast library of built-in functions and modules that you can use in your programs.

#### Using `math` module
```python
import math

# Calculating the square root
print(math.sqrt(25))

# Finding the sine of an angle
angle_in_degrees = 30
angle_in_radians = math.radians(angle_in_degrees)
print(math.sin(angle_in_radians))
```

#### Using `random` module
```python
import random

# Generating a random integer between 1 and 10
print(random.randint(1, 10))

# Choosing a random element from a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(random.choice(fruits))
```

**Exercise**: Use a function from the `datetime` module to print the current date.

---

## Defining Functions
In Python, you can define your own functions to perform specific tasks.

#### Basic Function
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(10, 15)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

#### Function with Default Parameters
```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
print(greet("Bob", "Good morning"))
```

**Exercise**: Write a function `multiply` that takes two parameters and returns their product.

---

## Tuples and Lists
Tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items in Python. Tuples are immutable, while lists are mutable.

#### Working with Tuples
```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Accessing tuple elements
print("X Coordinate:", coordinates[0])
print("Y Coordinate:", coordinates[1])
```

#### Working with Lists
```python
# Creating a list
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

# Adding an element to the list
colors.append("yellow")

# Accessing list elements
print(colors[0])  # First element
print(colors[-1]) # Last element

# Iterating over a list
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

**Exercise**: Create a tuple with three different animals and use a `for` loop to print each animal.

---

## Files
File handling in Python allows you to read and write files.

#### Writing to a File
```python
with open("example_write.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello Python!\n")
    file.write("Writing to files is simple.")
```

#### Appending to a File
```python
with open("example_append.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appending a new line to the file.\n")
```

#### Reading from a File Line by Line
```python
with open("example_read.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # .strip() removes the newline character at the end
```

**Exercise**: Write a program that reads a file named `data.txt` and prints its contents.

Certainly! I'll provide a set of practice questions along with their solutions. These will encompass various topics like control flow, loops, functions, lists, tuples, and pattern printing, which are commonly used in Python programming.

        return "Positive"
    elif num < 0:
        return "Negative"
    else:
        return "Zero"
